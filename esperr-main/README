Prerequisites:

 - Python 2.3+, Numeric, Pyrex
 - python-bio-tolls in PYTHONPATH at runtime
 - Pypar to use rp_adapt_mpi

Install:

  Distutils can be used as usual (python setup.py) or just type 
  'make inplace' to build the extension models in place. Make test
  to verify some things (just training/scoring with the standard 
  model at the moment).
